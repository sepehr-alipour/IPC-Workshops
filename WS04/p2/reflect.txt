1. In this workshop, we have 3 arrays which are defined as: costs, financing and priorities that have a maximum of 10 length.
The key here is the index of the array that user choose as a menu, for example for accessing the priorities, user choose a number between
1 to 3 and the key here is the number of priorities that by iterating we can access items that are selected as priority

2. Since indexes of arrays start from zero, the first index of iteration is 0. For example: to check selected finances by 'y'
in array we should iterate and check from index 0 for all of items:
for (i = 0; i < userItems; i++)
{
	if (financing[i] == 'y') {

		hasFinance = 1; //set 1 to show notes
	}


}

3. Imagine you have a group of chips in a packet (Pringles), each item in a packet are one item of the whole packet. You can count them up to down (1,2,3,...)
As I mentioned before you have a packet of chips so you do not find chocolate from them.
In computers, we have this sort of chips as an Array. The arrays in computer programming have the same types that you should count them from 0.
So if you want to pick the third chips from the packet you can eat 2 chips and then you have access to the third one while in computers if you want access to
the third item of the array you need to start from zero then first and the second one is our third item.
