1. It helps us to collect a bunch of data like number of lives,treasures, bombs and etc 
and access to them by iterating one for loop in search of parallel array.


2. We need to define another struct that keeps array of movements and number of lives, treasures, moves and last position that define as:

struct gameplay
{
int liveCount;
int moveCount;
int tresureCount;
int lastPosition;
int historyMovement[pathLength];
}

struct gameplay[maxPlays];

3. The board section of the game needs more time to figure out what is the current state. I did this section by debugging and testing the block separately
and checking by simple number to pass the block test.
