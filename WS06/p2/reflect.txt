1. The ReportData structure has 9 members that include 6 double variables which are allocated 24 bytes (4 bytes per integer variable),
and 3 integer variables that allocated 24 bytes ( 8 bytes per integer variable).
Therefore it occupied at least 48 bytes of memory.
Since we can use structures by address or passing information that the displayReportData is implemented by passing
the information, we can improve optimize our code to pass the address of the struct and use the value of members that are allocated in the memory.

2. We can define a structure member of CatFoodInfo and remove the same members from ReportData structure.
struct ReportData {
        struct CatFoodInfo catFoodInfo;
        double lbsWeight;
        double kgWeight;
        double totalServing;
        double costServing;
        double costCalories;
};

void displayReportData(const struct ReportData reportData, const int record) {

        printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf",
                reportData.catFoodInfo.sku,
                reportData.catFoodInfo.price,
                reportData.catFoodInfo.lbsWeight,
                reportData.kgWeight,
                reportData.grWeight,
                reportData.catFoodInfo.calories,
                reportData.totalServing,
                reportData.costServing,
                reportData.costCalories);
